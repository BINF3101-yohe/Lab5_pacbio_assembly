## Introduction

Last lab we downloaded the raw sequencing reads for a species of budding yeast. Then we trimmed the reads to remove adaptor sequences and any other reads that were low quality. 

We now need to assemble those DNA fragments into a genome assembly. Most of the species you are studying _have never been sequenced before!_ Therefore we need to do a _de novo_ assembly. We will go over what that means more in depth in class. Briefly, we need to find overlapping reads and put them together like a puzzle. 



&nbsp;
## Step 1 - Create a clean folder to work in

Let's create a new folder and download our PacBio fastq fils into that folder

```bash
mkdir lab_5
```

Then fetch your read files in the lab_5 directory. If you saved yours somewhere else, you should amend this command.

```bash
cd lab_5
wget https://zenodo.org/records/5702408/files/SRR8534473_subreads.fastq.gz
wget https://zenodo.org/records/5702408/files/SRR8534474_subreads.fastq.gz
wget https://zenodo.org/records/5702408/files/SRR8534475_subreads.fastq.gz
```
This may take a few minutes. Once it is done, check the three have downloaded in the lab_5 directory using ```ls```
&nbsp;

Give the files the correct permission if they are red.
```
chmod 777 *gz
```

## Step 2 - Run _do novo_ assembly with Flye

Flye is designed for a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to large mammalian-scale assemblies. The package represents a complete pipeline: it takes raw PacBio / ONT reads as input and outputs polished contigs. Flye also has a special mode for metagenome assembly. All informations about Flye assembler are here: [Flye]([url](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye/)).


### Step 2a - Edit the slurm script

We are going to grow up into more advanced and independent bioinformaticians where I no longer give you the exact slurm script. Yay!

Inspect what flye is capable of and all of the available options.
```bash
module load flye
flye --help
```

A lot, right?!

The relevant commands we need to include are ```--pac-bio-raw```, set the ```--iterations``` to "1", and set the output directory --iterations 1 ```--out-dir SRR853447_pacbio_assembly```.
Make sure to include all three of your sets of reads in your command!


### Step 2b - Find our optimal k-mer size

You will get a printout from you run that contains your optimal k-mer size. Write it down! You will need it for the next step.

## LQ 1

What k-mer size was chosen for you by kmergenie?

&nbsp;
## Step 3 - Assemble your genome

Now we will use a genome assembler called ABySS (Assembly By Short Sequences). We will go more into depth as to how this assembler works in class

### Step 3a - Copy the slurm script

Copy the slurm script from the class folder to your directory where you have the sequence files

```bash
cp /projects/class/binf3101_001/abyss.slurm .
```

**TIP** The "." in the command above means "here". You are copying (cp) the first file (/projects/class/binf3101_001/abyss.slurm) to here (.)

### Step 3b - Edit the slurm script

You will need to edit the slurm script to include your k-mer number after "k=" and change SRXXXXXX to your SRR number

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58dd1308-5db4-47d9-af28-8727f806c0fb)


Refer to lab #1 if you need help remembering how to edit a file using vi or nano. 

You can also check to make sure your edits are correct using ```cat abyss.slurm```

### Step 3c - Submit your slurm script

Submit your slurm script 

```bash
sbatch abyss.slurm
```

Then you can check to make sure it is running using

```bash
squeue -u unccusername
```

IF THIS STEP DOES NOT WORK - EMAIL Dr. LABELLA IMMEDIATELY! 

When the assembly is done you will see a file called "slurm-number.out" that will be the report of the run

You will also see a lot of files that end in dot, path, fa, hist, fai, dot1 and more.

This process can take between 10 and 20 minutes!

Our assembly is in this file: SRRXXXXXXX-**contigs.fa**

### Step 3d - Make a copy of your final file and rename it

Abyss leaves us with a complicated set of files which have aliases (additional names)

To prevent any issues we are going to make a copy 

```bash
cp SRRXXXXXXX-contigs.fa SRRXXXXXXX-contigs.v1.fa
```

## Step 4 - Analyze our genome quality 

We are going to use a program called QUAST to assess our genome quality. Quast does not like the packages we previously loaded. So you can either log out of the cluster and log back in OR we can leave the bubble

To reset our terminal, we will need to unload everything


```bash
module purge
```

**TIP** The module purge command is very useful. It's a good idea to run it if you are having problems with 


### Step 4a - load the genome quality assessment program

We will be using Quast to look at our genome quality. It is already installed on the cluster, so we need to load the module

```bash
module load quast
```

### Step 4b - Analyze your genome quality

To run quast on our genome assembly use the command below

```bash
quast.py SRRXXXXXXX-contigs.v1.fa
```


### Step 4c - Look at our genome quality results

You will find the genome quality results in a folder called ```quast_results```

Within that folder, there will be additional folders for each analysis you have run (if you ran it more than once) labeled by the date. 

Quast provides us with graphics and text output. If you want to look at the plots they are in the ```basic_stats``` folder and you will need to download them to look at this. 

All our results are saved in a file called ```report.txt```

Navigate into the folder containing your results and open/cat the report.txt file


## LQ 2

Report the following genome statistics in the Canvas assignment
- contigs under 1000 bp ( contigs (>= 0b bp) )
- size of the largest contig
- total length of the genome
- N50 value

## Step 5 - Filter the small contigs from our genome 

In the Quast output you should see a line that says "All statistics are based on contigs of size >= 500 bp". We want to remove the small contigs from our genome. We will use a custom python script to do that

### Step 5a - Copy the script from the class folder

Copy the script from the class folder
```bash
cp /projects/class/binf3101_001/filter_by_length.py .
```

This will copy the script to your current directory

### Step 5b - Find largest contig size

You will need to look at your Quast results and **find the size of your largest contig**

### Step 5c - Filter your genome

Now we will filter the genome to remove contigs that are less than 500bp long. 

**If you are getting "cannot import matplotlib" you must load anaconda3**

```bash
module load anaconda3
python filter_by_length.py SRRXXXXXXX-contigs.v1.fa SRRXXXXXXX-contigs.v2.fa 500 NyourlargestN
```

Don't forget! You will need to change the larger number to your biggest contig size. 

## LQ 3

How many contigs (sequences) are in the final version of your genome? _Hint: This is printed out in the console or we have used grep to count this in the past_

## Assembled genome!

You now have now conducted a _de novo_ genome assembly directly from Illumina sequencing reads! Your genome is now saved in SRRXXXXXXX-contigs.v2.fa
